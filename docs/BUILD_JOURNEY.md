# Aegis build journey

This file is the human-readable history of the project. Each week gets a section with a date, what was built, what worked, what didn't, and a screenshot where one exists. The point is to leave a visible record so anyone reading the repo for the first time can scroll this file and follow the path from empty folder to live tool.

Code lives in the rest of the repo. This file is the story.

## Week 1 (29 May 2026)

Set up the project foundation. Python 3.11 virtual environment, project folder structure (`src/`, `data/`, `docs/`, `notebooks/`, `tests/`), a Streamlit Hello World page running at localhost:8501, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `LICENSE` (All Rights Reserved), and the README. Downloaded the six source PDFs into `data/`: the EU AI Act, Annex III (currently a duplicate of the Act, used for testing the slicing logic in a later week), the Irish General Scheme of the AI Regulation Bill 2026, and the three chapters of the GPAI Code of Practice (Transparency, Copyright, Safety and Security).

Local git repository initialised, public GitHub repo created at github.com/noble-chidera-onyema/aegis, first commit `3b7fb4c` pushed. Description and topic tags set for discoverability.

No screenshot for Week 1. The build was completed before this journey log existed.

## Week 2 (30 May 2026, the day after Week 1)

Built the retrieval pipeline. Indexed `ai_act.pdf` (144 pages) into 296 chunks of around 800 characters each with 100-char overlap, generated a 384-dimensional embedding for each chunk using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, and wrote the vectors to a local Chroma collection at `chroma_db/ai_act_v1`. Wrote a smoke test at `src/aegis/test_retrieval.py` that runs three sample queries against the index and prints the top three chunks per query with page number and similarity score.

Honest limitations at this stage. pypdf introduces letter-spacing artefacts on the CELEX-format PDF ("high-r isk", "Ar ticle"). Top-3 similarity scores currently sit in the 0.36 to 0.53 range, which is the loosely-related band rather than the strongly-relevant band. Query 3 ("Which AI practices are prohibited under the Act?") did not return Article 5 in the top three results, which is a real miss. All three issues are noted for the Week 8 evaluation harness, where the embedding model, PDF extraction library, and hybrid-search options get decided based on measured numbers rather than vibes.

The screenshot shows the project file tree on the left, the `test_retrieval.py` source code in the editor, the terminal output proving end-to-end retrieval works, and the git commit being made with the honest commit message naming the limitations.

Note on dates. Week 2 was built 30 May 2026, one day after Week 1, not after a full calendar week. The work was done in a single extended overnight session. Future weeks will not all be this compressed.

## Week 3 (31 May 2026, two days after Week 2)

Built the grounded question-and-answer layer on top of the Week 2 retrieval pipeline. The script in `src/aegis/grounded_qa.py` takes a question, retrieves the top five passages from the Chroma index, sends them to Groq with Llama 3.3 70B, and prints an answer that quotes the passages with `[page N]` citations. A system prompt constrains the model to answer only from the retrieved passages, refuse when the passages do not cover the question, and end every answer with the disclaimer line "This is decision-support, not legal advice. Verify with qualified counsel."

A planning detail worth recording. The locked spec was built around 6 to 12 hours per week. The build pace has been faster, with Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3 completed across 29, 30, and 31 May. The dates in this log reflect what actually happened, not the original schedule.

One non-trivial decision during the build. The `llama-index-llms-groq` wrapper that works with the current `llama-index-core==0.14.22` pins an older `transformers` library, which would force a downgrade of `sentence-transformers` and break Week 2 retrieval. The project calls Groq's official Python SDK directly instead. Retrieval still uses LlamaIndex. The LLM call is now `groq_client.chat.completions.create(...)` with a hand-written prompt template. This trades a small convenience for transparency, a simpler dependency tree, and prompt-template control the Week 4 risk classifier needs.

Three sample questions, hand-checked against the source document. Article 13 transparency obligations: retrieved passages from pages 21, 34, 35, 46, 114; answer cited page 21 consistently; honest that the full text of Article 13 was not in the top-5 chunks. General-purpose AI obligations: retrieved passages from pages 26, 27, 31, 67, 85; answer cited pages 31 and 85; covered the authorised-representative requirement. Article 5 prohibited practices: retrieved passages from pages 4, 8, 12, 51; top passage was Article 4 (literacy), not Article 5; the model produced a correct list of four Article 5 prohibitions citing page 51, but used a combination of one partial passage and its training knowledge of the Act. This partial-grounding case is flagged in `tests/test_questions.md` for the Week 8 evaluation harness.

The screenshot shows the project file tree with `grounded_qa.py` and `test_questions.md` in place, the editor on the closing lines of the main function, and the terminal output of the Article 5 answer with `[page 51]` citations on each prohibited practice.

Known limitations carrying forward. pypdf still produces letter-spacing artefacts in the retrieved text ("high-r isk", "Ar ticle"); the model is robust to this in its outputs but the chunks remain noisy. Top-5 retrieval is the current setting; Week 8 will test 3, 5, and 10 against a hand-labelled set. The Article 5 partial-grounding case shows the model occasionally fills gaps with general knowledge of the Act; citation accuracy testing in Week 8 will quantify how often this happens. All similarity scores still sit in the 0.35 to 0.50 band.

## Up next

Week 4, the risk classifier. Take a plain-language description of an AI system, retrieve relevant articles and Annex III categories, and return a structured classification into one of four tiers (prohibited, high-risk, limited-risk, minimal-risk) with reasoning and citations.
