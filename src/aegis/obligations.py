"""
Aegis obligations and gap report.

Given a Classification (from src/aegis/classify.py), produce a structured
report of the obligations that apply under the EU AI Act, with the Article
and page citation for each, and a plain-language note about why each
obligation applies to the user's specific system.

Three layers, each separately auditable:
1. The Article-to-tier mapping (hardcoded from the Act).
2. The source passage for each Article (retrieved from the Chroma index).
3. The plain-language "applies_because" explanation (LLM-generated, but
   constrained to the user's specific description and the retrieved passage).

If retrieval fails for an Article, the report still shows the hardcoded
title and description with a flag noting the source passage was not found.
If the LLM call fails, the report still shows the hardcoded obligation
without the per-system explanation. The user always gets something useful.

Week 6 Streamlit UI will import generate_report() directly.

Run from the project root for a CLI demonstration:

The user's AI system has already been classified into a specific EU AI Act risk tier, and a specific obligation from that tier applies to it. Your job is to write a short note (2 to 3 sentences) explaining why this particular obligation applies to their specific system description.

Rules:
1. The tier has already been decided. Write only about why THIS obligation applies under the ALREADY-ASSIGNED tier. Do NOT suggest, imply, or speculate that the system might be a different tier (do not say it "may be high-risk", "could be prohibited", etc.). If you are tempted to question the tier, do not; that is not your task here.
2. Stay grounded in the user's description. Do not invent details about their system. If the description is thin, keep the note general rather than inventing a risk profile.
3. Reference the obligation's Article and its general purpose, not the verbatim text of the Act.
4. Be concrete about what THIS obligation will look like for THEIR system, within the assigned tier.
5. Output plain text only. No JSON, no markdown, no preamble.
